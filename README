Initialize Project


Some notes: Have the ability to sort courses by course name, 
program (cardio-adult, adult swim) which is often same as course name, section
which refers to (fitness, aquatic, general interest etc.) as well as subsection
(adult, child/youth, etc) and also course type (regular or drop-in)

Then we can sort courses by individual faciltiies within a location, 
and sort facilities by type (room, pool-A, gym etc.), and we can sort locations
by district and by ward.

We can look at number of participants registered, the number that show up over the 
duration with visits, number of sessions by looking at days of the week and number 
of weeks, as well as min and max amount registered. We can also see demand by 
looking at waitlist size

With this understanding, what can we do?

I am in aquatics, so I am interested in looking at aquatics courses. Can make a 
bar plot of aquatics courses by ward or district, to see which were most offered. 
(Wards/districts/locations would be colours). Then for those courses we can see 
popular they were by plotting #registered vs visits/#weeks. We can also look at 
#instances of a coursevvs waitlist size or #num_reg+waitlist or something like 
that. We can seperate all of these by ward, district or location.

#reg vs mean visits/#weeks by district will be our project
